things to fix:

TODO: test all doors: in and out
	test accessing wrong doors
	pressing a move key before rolling the dice causes that move to be applied after pressing roll:
		- FIXED: reset key message char at the beginning of doMovement.



watch out for
on suggestion continue: weapon cards out of bound at index 5. size should be 6
sometimes on door exit, player moves 2 spaces
door exit from dining room(right) spawns char 1 square above door
next player turn skipped after another player suggests(standard end turn or accuse message)
char b has been moved to room by char a's suggestion: on char b's turn(which is next), they get " you may now  end your turn or make an accusation"


helpful things to do:
draw current player's character in game.draw so it is drawn after board, and on top of any other char piece
change die image to index 0 upon room entry









goals:
message to choose accusation or suggestion not coming up
finish turns
jmenu
next turn button: much better than a dialog
tool tips
hide cards except when hovering over
click to exit room
