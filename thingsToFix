things to fix:






watch out for
on suggestion continue: weapon cards out of bound at index 5. size should be 6
sometimes on door exit, player moves 2 spaces
door exit from dining room(right) spawns char 1 square above door
next player turn skipped after another player suggests(standard end turn or accuse message)
char b has been moved to room by char a's suggestion: on char b's turn(which is next), they get " you may now  end your turn or make an accusation"


helpful things to do:
player number needed in title of text query dialog
better rope image
during movement turn(at start) if player pushes next turn, they get preaccusation dialog
draw current player's character in game.draw so it is drawn after board, and on top of any other char piece
change die image to index 0 upon room entry









goals:
message to choose accusation or suggestion not coming up
finish turns
jmenu
next turn button: much better than a dialog
tool tips
hide cards except when hovering over
click to exit room
