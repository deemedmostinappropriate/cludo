things to fix:


on suggestion continue: weapon cards out of bound at index 5. size should be 6
player number needed in title of text query dialog
weapon sometimes drawn at 0,24 which is out of bounds
better rope image


goals:
message to choose accusation or suggestion not coming up
finish turns
jmenu
next turn button: much better than a dialog
tool tips
hide cards except when hovering over
click to exit room
