things to fix:


Test
tell player to click on door or make accusation when relevant
the whole roomTurn method

after moving out of room, if back in new room (is possible) no suggestion asked of player

player cards dont change in gui over turns
on suggestion continue: weapon cards out of bound at index 5. size should be 6
player number needed in title of text query dialog
candlestick appearing in arrow of hall
weapon sometimes drawn at 0,24 which is out of bounds
better rope image


goals:
message to choose accusation or suggestion not coming up
finish turns
jmenu
next turn button: much better than a dialog
tool tips
hide cards except when hovering over
click to exit room
